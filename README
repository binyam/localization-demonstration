This is a visual demonstration of the localization algorithm that was
discussed in the homework assignment 1.4 of the Udacity course CS373. The
arrow keys can be used to move the object that is being localized (the black
square). The map on the right will show the predictions of the algorithm. If
a move failed, the square will stay on the same tile. If the sensor
registered the wrong color, the square will turn red.

This example uses HTML5 canvas and has been tested on the Linux versions of 
Firefox 10 and Chromium 17.
